A Biological Material Inventory Management System.

## API Documentation
The documentation for the Bionet API can be found [here](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/api.md).

## Development Process
The development process can be followed step-by-step by reviewing the 'walkthrough':  

1. [Environment](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/1.environment.md) - Setup your development environement by installing Git, Node, NPM and Visual Studio Code.  
2. [Scaffolding](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/2.scaffolding.md) - Create a React Application and a Node JSON API and run them concurrently on separate ports.
3. [Configure React](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/3.react.1.md) - Begin React application setup. Add Bootstrap 4 UI Library and Material Design Icons, Router and placeholder Routes and Sassy CSS (SCSS).  
4. [React Components - Part 1 - Bootstrap, Icons & Viewport Container](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/4.react.2.md) - Continue React application setup. Add a Viewport Container with Responsive Background Image, Bootstrap Responsive Grid Components and a Bootstrap Card component to display data.  
5. [React Components - Part 2 - Navigation & Footer](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/5.react.3.md) - Add a Responsive Navigation and Footer, scaffold pages for routes.  
6. [Configure API - Part 1 - The Database](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/6.api.1.md) - Setup the API connection to a mongoDB instance.  
7. [Configure API - Part 2 - Authentication](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/7.api.2.md) - Setup API JWT Authentication.  
8. [React Authentication](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/8.react.4.md) - Setup React Authentication.  
9. [React Code Splitting](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/9.react.5.md) - Setup React Error Boundaries, Suspense and Lazy Loading.  
10. [API Models](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/10.api.3.md) - Expand the database models to include Labs, Containers, Physicals and Virtuals.
