1. [Environment](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/1.environment.md) - Setup your development environement by installing Git, Node, NPM and Visual Studio Code.  
2. [Scaffolding](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/2.scaffolding.md) - Create a React Application and a Node JSON API and run them concurrently on separate ports.
3. [Configure React - Part 1](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/3.react.1.md) - Begin React application setup. Add Boostrap 4 UI Library and Material Design Icons, Router and placeholder Routes.  
4. [Configure React - Part 2](https://github.com/biobricks/bionet/blob/master/walkthrough/4.react.2.md) - Continue React application setup. Add Application State and Props, Sassy CSS (SCSS), a responsive top navigation and several page layouts.
