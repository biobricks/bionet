# Configure API - Part 1 - The Database

## Database Setup
We are currently using [mLab](https://mlab.com/) for a remote [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database instance as they have a free 'sandbox' tier that at the time of this writing allows for use of 500MB of data per instance with up to 100 instances.

## Install Required Modules
We will need to install the following npm modules from the terminal:
```bash
npm i mongoose
```

## Add Configuration File
Before we can connect to the database, we need a place to securely store our database username and password.  We will do this in a configuration file found at `./api/config.js`.   
Create the file from the terminal:
```bash
touch api/config.js
```
Place the following inside of `./api/config.js`:
```js
const Config = {
  db: {
    URI: 'ds123456.mlab.com:12345/yourdbname', // location of db instance
    username: 'myDbUser', // username created for db instance
    password: 'myDbPassword' // password for db user
  },
  jwt: {
    secret: 'thisistheappsecret' // a secret token used later for authentication
  }
};

module.exports = Config;
```
**Important** - We need to make sure that this information is not shared to the `.git` respository, otherwise our password and app secret will be visible to the public!  To avoid this, we omit our configuration file from version control by adding it to our projects `./.gitignore` file:
```bash
# ...
# API configuration
config.js

```

## Connect To Database
Next we will configure our `./api/server.js` file to connect to our database:
```js
// add require
// ...
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); // mongoDB object modeling
const Config = require('./config.js'); // api configuration


/***********************/
/* Connect To Database */
/***********************/
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise; // sets mongoose promise to use node native promise

let dbConnectionString = `mongodb://${Config.db.username}:${Config.db.password}@${Config.db.URI}`;
  
const dbOptions = {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
  family: 4,  
  keepAlive: 1, 
  connectTimeoutMS: 30000
};

mongoose.connect(
  dbConnectionString,
  dbOptions
, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('There was a problem connecting to the db.');
  } else {
    console.log('Connection to db successful.');
  }
});
 

```
To see that the connection to the database worked, you will need to restart the node server by:  
Stopping the server - from the terminal session running the app press `CTRL + C` on Windows or `CMD + C` on a Mac.  
Restart the server - `npm start`.  

## Nodemon 
To avoid the frustration of having to restart the server everytime there are changes, the `nodemon` module 'watches' the file for changes and restarts the node script for you when changes occur.

### Install Nodemon
From the terminal:
```bash
npm i nodemon --save-dev
```

### Update Package.json
The `nodemon` module works by using `nodemon` instead of `node` when starting a script.  This currently applies to our `concurrently` script starting both the `./api/server.js` file and the `react-scripts` instantiation.  
Update `./package.json`:
```js
// Update npm scripts from:
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"node api/server\" \"react-scripts start\"",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
// To
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"nodemon api/server\" \"react-scripts start\"", // 'node' changed to 'nodemon'
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```
