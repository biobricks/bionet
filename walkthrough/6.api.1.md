# Configure API - Part 1 - The Database

## Database Setup
We are currently using [mLab](https://mlab.com/) for a remote [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database instance as they have a free 'sandbox' tier that at the time of this writing allows for use of 500MB of data per instance with up to 100 instances.

## Install Required Modules
We will need to install the following npm modules from the terminal:
```bash
npm i mongoose
```

## Add Configuration File
Before we can connect to the database, we need a place to securely store our database username and password.  We will do this in a configuration file found at `./api/config.js`.   
Create the file from the terminal:
```bash
touch api/config.js
```
Place the following inside of `./api/config.js`:
```js
const Config = {
  db: {
    URI: 'ds123456.mlab.com:12345/yourdbname', // location of db instance
    username: 'myDbUser', // username created for db instance
    password: 'myDbPassword' // password for db user
  },
  jwt: {
    secret: 'thisistheappsecret' // a secret token used later for authentication
  }
};

module.exports = Config;
```
**Important** - We need to make sure that this information is not shared to the `.git` respository, otherwise our password and app secret will be visible to the public!  To avoid this, we omit our configuration file from version control by adding it to our projects `./.gitignore` file:
```bash
# ...
# API configuration
config.js

```

## Connect To Database
Next we will configure our `./api/server.js` file to connect to our database:
```js
// add require
// ...
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); // mongoDB object modeling
const Config = require('./config.js'); // api configuration


/***********************/
/* Connect To Database */
/***********************/
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise; // sets mongoose promise to use node native promise

let dbConnectionString = `mongodb://${Config.db.username}:${Config.db.password}@${Config.db.URI}`;
  
const dbOptions = {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
  family: 4,  
  keepAlive: 1, 
  connectTimeoutMS: 30000
};

mongoose.connect(
  dbConnectionString,
  dbOptions
, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('There was a problem connecting to the db.');
  } else {
    console.log('Connection to db successful.');
  }
});
 

```
To see that the connection to the database worked, you will need to restart the node server by:  
Stopping the server - from the terminal session running the app press `CTRL + C` on Windows or `CMD + C` on a Mac.  
Restart the server - `npm start`.  

## Nodemon 
To avoid the frustration of having to restart the server everytime there are changes, the `nodemon` module 'watches' the file for changes and restarts the node script for you when changes occur.

### Install Nodemon
From the terminal:
```bash
npm i nodemon --save-dev
```

### Update Package.json
The `nodemon` module works by using `nodemon` instead of `node` when starting a script.  This currently applies to our `concurrently` script starting both the `./api/server.js` file and the `react-scripts` instantiation.  
Update `./package.json`:
```js
// Update npm scripts from:
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"node api/server\" \"react-scripts start\"",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
// To
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"nodemon api/server\" \"react-scripts start\"", // 'node' changed to 'nodemon'
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

## Add Route Files

### Create Routes Directory
Our API currently has only one route, the landing route.  This will quickly change as we add more functionality to the API.  In order to keep our code readable we will create a `./api/routes` directory to hold our categorized route files.  
From the terminal:
```bash
mkdir api/routes
```

### Create Route Files
The routes for the Bionet are currently grouped by:  
- Static - Routes for displaying fixed or static information as opposed to changing or dynamic content.
- Auth - Routes that pertain to authentication logic.
- Models - Routes that query the database for records.
We will create route files for each within the `./api/routes` directory from the terminal:
```bash
touch api/routes/static.js
touch api/routes/auth.js
touch api/routes/models.js
```

### Static Routes
Our only route at the moment is the static landing route, lets move the route from `./api/server.js` to the `./api/routes/static.js` route file:
```js
// ./api/server.js

// ...

// Change Landing Route From
api.get('/', (req, res) => { // http get request to landing page
  res.json({ // respond with json
    success: true,
    message: "Welcome to the Bionet API.",
    errors: [],
    data: {}
  });
});
// To a route file require, 'piping' in our 'api' object

/***********************/
/* Routes              */
/***********************/

require('./routes/static.js')(api); // static info routes
```
